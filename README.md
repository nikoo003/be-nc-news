## Getting Started

### Connecting to Databases Locally

1. **Create Environment Variable Files**:
    - Create two `.env` files in the root directory of your project: `.env.development` and `.env.test`.
    - Add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names)

2. **Ensure `.env` Files are Gitignored**:
    - Confirm that your `.gitignore` includes `.env.*` to prevent these files from being committed

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Install Project Dependencies**:
    - Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies
